## Goal
Fully automated stock evaluation algorithm.


## Setup
Change into the directory you want the project to live in and then just copy the following code into your terminal, this will create a new repository called cronex containing everything.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:alexdietsche/cronex.git
```
## File Structure

Current file structure, will most definitely change, still a python rookie.

```
App
    main.py
res
    ticker.txt
output
    outputfiles...

```
